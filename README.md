# Birthday-Paradox-Cpp

This repository contains a C++ implementation of the Birthday Paradox simulation. The program explores the concept of the Birthday Paradox by generating random birthdays and determining the probability of two or more people sharing the same birthday within a group.

## Features
- Generates random birthdays for a specified number of people.
- Determines if there are any matching birthdays within the group.
- Conducts a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability of matching birthdays.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the number of birthdays to generate.
